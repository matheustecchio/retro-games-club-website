                <p>Our club is more than a regular club, we have loads of old video games, gameboys, monitors, joystick and controller. Those equipaments are expensive to buy and maintain, as they are rare nowadays. Our fee help us to maintain good quality equipments, we also need to buy chairs, table, and pay for the room cleaning.</p>
